BlocksMC SkyWars TNT griefing bot.

Still not finished!

**I may change this bot to public bot instead of griefing bot.**


## What is this bot?
The bot joins SkyWars game on BlocksMC server, it choose TNT kit then explodes the team.

>  **I'm not responsible if you use this in BlocksMC, use this at your own risk!**

## Known Bugs/Problems:

- Bot doesn't place redstone if there's chest or snow under the bot.
- TNT placement is *slow*..

  

## TODOs

- [ ] Make the TNT placement better, faster and cause more damage.
